    <p class="p1">
 Photography is my passion. I like to do wildlife photography and I am also interested in fashion photography. Because of my interest in photography, I wanted to win this National Award so I applied to this competition. I like to play with the aperture and shutter speed play with the shallow depth of field bokeh effects and make the photograph more interesting and in a dramatic manner. I want to convey my story from that picture.  I am going deeper and deeper and want to study more about the photography and lights like Rim light Godfather light(where they are placed)  I want to study more about them and I want to become a pro in this field.</p>

  I also want to help the beginners who buy a camera and don't know how to use it so I made this website and I have also and YouTube channel in that I will be more active in that channel after some time.In this  website you will learn the basics of photography like:ISO,aperture,shutter speed and how to take a good photograph. In this website I have put how to take a good  photograph and how to use the flash tricks of flash I will upload more courses and more content in this website so,i hope that you will be able to learn the basics of the photography because basics of photography is very important.After    learning the basics of photography you will be able to learn more about light like where rim light is kept. The Godfather light are kept and many more.
